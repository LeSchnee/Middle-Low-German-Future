# Middle-Low-German-Future

This repository contains the python script used to convert the results from the collatinus tagger ((https://github.com/biblissima/collatinus)) into csv spreadsheets ready for annotations.
You may also have a look at our data structure allready, which is documented in the data dictionairy. The annotated data will be published, too, in some point in the *future*.
